# create-commerce-app
A Salesforce Commerce application generator that allows you to generate a sample commerce storefront application. It installs the sfcc-sample-apps applications as a new application without having to clone this repository or the sfcc-sample-apps repository. 

## Prerequisites
Download and install [Node.js v12](https://nodejs.org/en/download/). 
â€‹
> **Note:** Only Node.js v12 is supported. Any other version can cause unexpected results. To use a different version of Node.js for other projects, you can manage multiple versions of Node.js with [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm).

## Quick Start

To get up and running execute the following command in a shell/terminal:

```
npx create-commerce-app your-app-name
```

This will run a npx installation of create-commerce-app and create a sample Salesforce Commerce Storefront app for you. It creates the app as a sub-directory of the current working directory with the name of the directory being the your-app-name provided while running the above command. More information about the sample Salesforce Commerce Storefront app and how to use it can be found [here](https://github.com/SalesforceCommerceCloud/sfcc-sample-apps)

## Setup

Follow the sample apps setup at https://github.com/SalesforceCommerceCloud/sfcc-sample-apps#setup. Start from step 3 which creates an api.mjs file.  Follow the setup through the end.

## Testing

```bash
npm run test
```
To print the detailed test results and errors on the console, execute
