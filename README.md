## Prerequisites
Download and install Node.js and npm [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

> **Note:** Only Node.js 12 LTS is supported. Any other version can cause unexpected results. To use a different version of Node.js for other projects, you can manage multiple versions of Node.js with [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm).

## Quick Start
