**This repo has been archived and is no longer in development. Please see https://github.com/SalesforceCommerceCloud/pwa-kit for using Salesforce Commerce APIs to build a headless shopping experience.**

A Salesforce Commerce application generator that allows you to generate a sample commerce storefront application.

## Prerequisites
Download and install Node.js and npm [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).
â€‹
> **Note:** Only Node.js 12 LTS is supported. Any other version can cause unexpected results. To use a different version of Node.js for other projects, you can manage multiple versions of Node.js with [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm).

## Quick Start

To get up and running execute the following command in a shell/terminal:

```
npx create-commerce-app your-app-name
```

This will run a npx installation of create-commerce-app and create a sample Salesforce Commerce Storefront app for you. It creates the app as a sub-directory of the current working directory with the name of the directory being the app name provided while running the above command. In order to run your new application, please follow the instructions for the [sample Salesforce Commerce Storefront app](https://github.com/SalesforceCommerceCloud/sfcc-sample-apps). You don't need to clone the sample apps repo, but you do need to run the yarn commands shown in the root directory of your new commerce app.
